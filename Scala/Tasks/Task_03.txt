1) Write a function that takes a union type parameter (e.g., int | string) and returns a formatted string based on the input type. 
2) Create a program that uses a union type to handle either an integer or a floating-point number, performing different operations based on the input. 
3) Design a type-safe function that accepts a union of int and bool, and returns a sum if both are numbers or a boolean AND operation if both are booleans.
4)Implement a function that processes a union type (e.g., number | string | null) and throws an error if the value is null, otherwise returns the value doubled if it's a number or uppercased if it's a string. 
5) Write a script that uses a union type to represent a dataset that can be either an array of integers or a single integer, and calculate the sum accordingly.
6) Create an extension method for the string class that adds a method to count vowels in a string.
7) Develop an extension method for the int type that checks if a number is prime.
8) Write an extension method for a custom class (e.g., Person) that adds a method to format the person's full name.
