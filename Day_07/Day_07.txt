Notes
-- Thread is single unit

Life Cycle
	- New
	- Runnable
	- Waiting
	- Timed Waiting
	- Terminated

run() - containing functionality
start() - call run() method
If we directly call the run(), it will behave like normal method not like thread.


DeadLock: When two or More thread locked a resourse and wait for another resourse which is locked by another thread

Preventation :
	- notify()
	- notifyAll()
	- wait()

LiveLock


---AfterNoon

1. Lambda function - (Parameter) -> { Expression }
2. Interface 

--Marker - with no methods e.g serialization
-- Functional Inteface - With only one Method e.g Runnable, Comparable, Callable.

Runnable - Only one Method Run() to run a thread
Comparable - Only one Method CompareTo to compare collection e.x Collection.sort(List<> name)


Question

1. Which Priority execute first ?
2. Can i directly run method.
3. Functional Interface vs Marker Interface Vs Inteface
