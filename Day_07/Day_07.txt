Notes
-- Thread is single unit

Life Cycle
	- New
	- Runnable
	- Waiting
	- Timed Waiting
	- Terminated

run() - containing functionality
start() - call run() method
If we directly call the run(), it will behave like normal method not like thread.


DeadLock: When two or More thread locked a resourse and wait for another resourse which is locked by another thread

Preventation :
	- notify()
	- notifyAll()
	- wait()

LiveLock
